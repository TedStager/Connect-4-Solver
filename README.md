# Connect-4-Solver
Uses a Negamax algorithm to provide the mathematically optimal move for Connect 4.

This project was heavily inspired by Pascal Pons' implementation of the same algorithm (see connect4.gamesolver.org) as well as various algorithms described on the Chess Programming Wiki (see chessprogramming.org).
